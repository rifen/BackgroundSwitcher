# BackgroundSwitcher
A autohotkey script that detects how many monitors you have and then sets the wallpaper you define depending on how many monitors are plugged in. 

- Really useful when you undock/dock into a multi-monitor setup. 
- Seems to work on any number of monitors you will just need to copy and paste the code past 3 mc.
- I put mine in `shell:startup` on Windows (Not sure about other OS).
- You will need to replace ***PATH*** and ***IMAGE NAME*** in dockingbg.ahk.
- You can change it from Fill to a different screen fit.
