# DockingBackground
A autohotkey script that detects how many monitors there are and then sets the wallpaper you define. Really useful when you undock/dock into a multi-monitor setup. Seems to work on any number of monitors you will just need to add to the code past 3 monitors.

I put mine in shell:startup on Windows (Not sure about other OS)

You will need to replace source and file variables
